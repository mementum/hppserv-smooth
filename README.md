hppserv-smooth
==============

Variant of my hppserv proxy which targets modification
of the Microsoft Smooth Streaming Protocool to control
streaming capabilities and bandwidth

For Python >= 2.7 (maybe 2.6)

Many of the concepts need to be reworked to make it
a good example and needs some cleaning up from
patches and experiments in the code, but it works
though
